## 📁 Project Description
This project demonstrates a real-world data cleaning exercise. It showcases the transformation of a messy dataset (`dirtydata.csv`) into a clean, analysis-ready dataset (`cleandata.xlsx`). The objective of this project is to illustrate essential data cleaning techniques used by data analysts to prepare data for accurate insights and decision-making.

##  ⚙️ Technolgies Used
* Excel
* SQL (SSMS)

## Data Processing
* Upload dataset to SSMS
* Create new table for clean data
* Remove unnecessay data
* Transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis
* * Change datatypes
  * Format names
  * Create new calculated fields

## 📥 How to Use the Project

1. **Download the dataset**  
   Get the raw dataset `dirtydata.csv` from the repository or the provided source.

2. **Inspect the dataset**  
   Open the file and review the first few rows.

3.  **Choose your tool**  
   You can clean the dataset using:
   - **Excel** for manual cleaning
   - **Python** for automation
   - **SQL** for SQL-based transformation

5. **Clean the data**  
   Apply the data cleaning steps such as removing duplicates, correcting column names, fixing missing values, and standardizing entries.

6. **Load into SQL Server (optional)**  
   If using SSMS:
   - Import the cleaned dataset into a new table.
   - Use SQL queries to validate and transform data as needed.

7. **Analyze or visualize**  
   Once clean, use the data in Power BI, Tableau, or your tool of choice for analysis, dashboards, or reports.

## 💡 Why This Matters
Clean data is the foundation of reliable analysis. This project is ideal for:

Learning and practicing basic data cleaning

Preparing datasets for BI tools (e.g., Power BI, Tableau)

Building a solid portfolio project for aspiring data analysts
